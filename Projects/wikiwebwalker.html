        As my time at UMass Amherst was coming to a close, I decided to take a course on Natural Language Processing. I
        had been interested in the topic for a while, but I had no experience with it. I was excited to learn more
        about how computers can understand and generate human language. Luckily, I found myself in the same class as
        some friends I made back during my freshman year, <a href="https://s3gfault.dev/">Jasmine Cai</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/20jgrassi">Jacob Grassi</a>. We decided to team up for the final project, and we
        came up with the idea of creating a tool that could solve The Wiki Game. Jasmine wrote a
        <a href="https://s3gfault.dev/blog/wikiwebwalker">wonderful article</a> on her blog about the project, which
        includes an easy-to-red step-by-step process of our development and the technical details of our solution. In
        addition, <a href="/Files/485_Final_Project_wikiwebwalker.pdf">this formal paper</a> was submitted to our
        professor with our final results and conclusions.
